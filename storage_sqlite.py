BLOCK: Storage — SQLite database
SLOT:  storage        (every app needs exactly one storage block)

WHAT THIS BLOCK DOES
    Exactly the same job as storage_json, but keeps the data in a real
    database file (data.db) instead of a text file. The functions have the
    same names and take the same arguments, so you can swap one for the other
    without changing any other block. That is the whole point of the kit.

WHY YOU MIGHT CHOOSE IT
    A database handles two programs writing at once, and it lets you write
    queries. More importantly for this module, it is where you meet
    *parameterised queries* — the single most important habit in this block.

WHAT YOU SHOULD SAY ABOUT IT IN YOUR REPORT
    The file itself is still unencrypted: anyone who can read data.db can read
    every record. What you gain over the JSON block is the ability to let the
    database engine separate code from data, which is what stops SQL injection.

    Look at the question mark in the SQL below, and the (username,) after it.
    That is a PARAMETERISED QUERY. We hand the database the shape of the
    question and the value separately, so the database never confuses one for
    the other.

    The tempting alternative looks like this, and is WRONG:

        conn.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "'")

    If someone types   ' OR '1'='1   as their username, that builds:

        SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1'

    ...which matches every row, because the typed text stopped being *data*
    and became part of the *query*. That is SQL injection, and it is the
    reason the question mark exists.

    The trailing comma in (username,) is not a typo. It is how Python writes a
    tuple containing exactly one thing.
